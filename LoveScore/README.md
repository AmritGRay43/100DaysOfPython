# ðŸ’– Love Score Calculator

This is a fun Python mini-project that calculates a "love score" between two names based on the number of times specific letters appear in their combined name. It's inspired by playful personality quizzes and is purely for entertainment.

## How It Works

The logic behind the score:
- It counts how many times the letters in **TRUE** appear in the combined names.
- Separately, it counts how many times the letters in **LOVE** appear.
- Then it combines both counts as a two-digit love score.

Example:
```python
calculate_love_score("Alice", "Bob")
# Output: Your love score is: 35
